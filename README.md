# Weather Prediction with Random Forest

Welcome to the Weather Prediction with Random Forest repository. This project aims to predict weather conditions by leveraging the power of Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm known for its accuracy in classification and regression tasks. The model is trained on historical weather data to forecast future weather metrics such as temperature, wind speed and humidity.
